**How does this past month's precipitation compare to the past 50 years' average?** 

This analysis investigates global precipitation data via publicly accessible data from the NOAA website, using an arrangment of tools for reproducible science. The final output is a daily-rendered infographic showing up-to-date Z-scores on regional precipitation over the past 30 days with respect to the historical average. 

This project was done in tandem with Pat Schloss and his Youtube channel, "Riffomonas."
