# drought
How does this past month's precipitation compare to that of the same period's average over the past 50 years? This analysis investigates global precipitation data via publicly accessible data from the NOAA website, using an arrangment of tools for reproducible science. This project was done in tandem with Pat Schloss and his Youtube channel, "Riffomonas."
